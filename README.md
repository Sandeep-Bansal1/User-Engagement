## Buisness Objective </b> 
- Through the use of machine learning, can we uncover the patterns that transform a casual reader into a loyal news enthusiast, keeping them engaged from headline to deep dive.

## Background </b> 
- In a fragmented media environment with seemingly endless sources of information to choose from, Americansâ€™ news habits have changed dramatically in the 21st century. Many seem to be dropping the old school daily habit of waking up in the morning to watch the news before work or dropping their child off to school to now checking their smartphones. However, with that being said does checking news via a cellular device increase the chances of a user reading an entire article? Are their other associated factors to consider when determining whether a reader will make it to the bottom of the article?


## Dataset </b> 
- This is a ficticious dataset that was created by the Python Library called Faker. It contains 250,000 rows and 44 attributes.
- The Data Dictionary below will help you become familiar with each column and what each of them represent.

## Proposed Methodology </b>
- Since our dataset includes a binary target column called **`Reached_Bottom_of_Article`**, which indicates whether a user scrolled to the end of a news article, we will apply several classification machine learning models to predict this behavior. The models we plan to use include **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosting**. These algorithms are well-suited for binary classification problems, where the goal is to determine the likelihood that a user fully engages with an article. By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to identify the most effective approach for predicting user engagement with news content.

## Exploratory Data Analysis </b>

- *High Growth Periods (April, June, December)*:
  - Significant YoY growth in these months indicates successful content strategies or campaigns. Replicate similar tactics to sustain engagement.

- *Drop in July and November*:
  - Notable declines suggest disengagement during these months. Address this with targeted campaigns, timely content, or seasonal promotions.

- *December Recovery*:
  - Strong recovery after the November dip highlights the effectiveness of holiday-related content. Plan seasonal strategies to capitalize on year-end engagement.

- *Stable Early-Year Engagement (Jan-March)*:
  - Consistent user visits in early months suggest steady consumption habits. Use this time to introduce new features and maintain engagement.
